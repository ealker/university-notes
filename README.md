# University Notes

In order to avoid distractions during lectures, my laptop stays in my bag and I handwrite my notes. I then review these handwritten notes later in the library or at home and type them up in markdown. This system has taken me a while to refine, and is based off of [this](https://www.cse.buffalo.edu//~rapaport/howtostudy.html#takenotesinclass) guide from the Computer Science department at the University of Buffalo. The guide is well worth the read for any university student. 

Each module has its own folder, and each markdown file is a compelte lecture. Sometimes lectures are spilt into multiple "parts".

For a complete list of the modules I'm taking/have taken, visit my personal [university profile](http://users.aber.ac.uk/ela12/).

## 1st Year Notes 



## Supplementary Notes 

You can get a lot more out of higher education if you go beyond reading the basic lecture notes and completeing your assignments. I wasn't always the best at doing the basics, but I always read beyond what was required. I have a good understaning of CS concepts because of this. Here is a list of good resources for you to extend your education: 

### CS Reading 
- [Teach Yourself CS](teachyourselfcs.com)
- [Notes to Freshman](https://github.com/nushackers/notes-to-cs-freshmen-from-the-future)
- [High School Guide to ML](https://github.com/kjaisingh/high-school-guide-to-machine-learning)
- [Distributed Systems Reading List](https://dancres.github.io/Pages/)
- [Your Missing Semester of CS](https://missing.csail.mit.edu) - this will get you ready for a job/internship. Don't leave it till third year.
- [Awesome Lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) - Learn practically anything with these lists.

### Thinking about how you learn
