# Additional Notes for CS22120 

Hi. You will be taught Java at Aberystwyth, however some of the conventions/recommendations are outdated. One such reccomendation is to put implementation classes together in a folder and name interfaces beggining with I. DO NOT DO THIS. 
Why? Please read this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2814805/java-interfaces-implementation-naming-convention and this https://martinfowler.com/bliki/InterfaceImplementationPair.html.
